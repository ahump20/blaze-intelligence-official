# Blaze Intelligence MLB Pilot Playbook

## Executive Summary
A 12-week implementation to prove Champion Enigma Engine (CEE) delivers measurable competitive advantage through quantified intangibles.

## Week 1-2: Data Integration Sprint

### Technical Setup
- [ ] MLB StatsAPI connection (roster, game feeds)
- [ ] Statcast integration (exit velocity, launch angle, sprint speed)
- [ ] Internal video feed access (dugout, mound visits, at-bats)
- [ ] Wearables API (if available: Whoop, Oura, Catapult)

### Baseline Collection
- [ ] 2024 season clutch situations catalog
- [ ] High-leverage at-bat library (9th inning, RISP)
- [ ] Injury/return-from-injury performance deltas
- [ ] Manager decision points with outcomes

## Week 3-4: CEE Calibration

### Pattern Training
- [ ] Tag 100 clutch moments with outcomes
- [ ] Visual signal extraction from video
- [ ] Physiological baseline per player
- [ ] Decision latency benchmarks

### Initial Scoring
- [ ] Generate first Champion Dimension scores
- [ ] Compare to traditional WAR/OPS+
- [ ] Identify signal/noise thresholds
- [ ] Create confidence intervals

## Week 5-8: Live Implementation

### Daily Workflow Integration
- **Morning**: Readiness scores published to coaching staff
- **Pre-game**: Individual CEE states + adjustment recommendations
- **In-game**: Live pressure state monitoring, bullpen readiness alerts
- **Post-game**: Performance vs. prediction audit, model updates

### Deliverables
- [ ] Coach Cards: One-page player adjustments
- [ ] Readiness Dashboard: Team-wide view
- [ ] Clutch Probability Feed: Real-time situational forecasts
- [ ] Development Tracker: Week-over-week dimension changes

## Week 9-10: Validation Sprint

### Metrics to Track
- **Decision Lift**: % improvement in high-leverage substitutions
- **Readiness Accuracy**: Correlation of morning scores to game performance
- **Injury Prevention**: False positive/negative rates on fatigue signals
- **Development Velocity**: Behavioral change in targeted dimensions

### A/B Testing
- Control group: Traditional analytics only
- Test group: CEE-enhanced decisions
- Measure: Win probability added, run differential, injury days

## Week 11-12: Scale & Report

### Documentation
- [ ] Evidence portfolio: 10 decisive moments where CEE changed outcomes
- [ ] ROI calculation: Wins added, salary efficiency gained
- [ ] Coach testimonials: Workflow impact statements
- [ ] Player feedback: Development acceleration examples

### Expansion Planning
- [ ] API specification for league-wide deployment
- [ ] Multi-team comparison framework
- [ ] Youth/development league adaptation
- [ ] Scouting integration blueprint

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative (Must Hit 3 of 4)
1. **+2 wins** vs. projection through better deployment
2. **15% reduction** in high-leverage decision errors
3. **80% correlation** between readiness scores and performance
4. **20% faster** targeted behavior change in development

### Qualitative (Must Hit 2 of 3)
1. Coaching staff daily active usage >80%
2. Player buy-in with voluntary biometric sharing >60%
3. Front office requests expansion to draft/trade evaluation

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Gaps
- **If biosignals unavailable**: Default to video-only CEE (70% signal retention)
- **If video limited**: Use broadcast + Statcast fusion
- **If resistance to change**: Start with single coach champion, expand gradually

### Technical Issues
- **Latency concerns**: Edge caching, pre-computed morning states
- **Integration friction**: Dedicated Blaze operator for first 4 weeks
- **Model drift**: Weekly recalibration, holdout validation

## Investment & Resources

### From Blaze
- 2 engineers (full-time for integration)
- 1 data scientist (model tuning)
- 1 baseball ops specialist (workflow design)
- 24/7 on-call support during games

### From Partner Org
- Data access permissions
- 1 analytics liaison
- Weekly 30-min coaching staff sync
- Champion coach to drive adoption

## Timeline to Value

- **Day 7**: First readiness scores delivered
- **Day 21**: Live in-game pressure states
- **Day 45**: Measurable decision improvement
- **Day 84**: Full ROI validation

## Post-Pilot Path

### Success Scenario
1. Convert to annual subscription
2. Expand to minor league system
3. Add draft/trade evaluation module
4. Co-develop proprietary dimensions

### Scale Timeline
- **Month 4-6**: Full season implementation
- **Month 7-9**: Multi-org pilots
- **Month 10-12**: League-wide offering
