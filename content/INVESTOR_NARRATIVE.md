# Blaze Intelligence: The $50B Conviction Economy

## The Opportunity

Professional sports is a $500B global industry where 90% of decisions are still made on gut feel dressed as statistics. The gap between what elite evaluators "know" and what they can prove costs teams hundreds of millions in mistaken contracts, missed talent, and lost games.

**Blaze Intelligence bridges that gap by turning instinct into auditable signal.**

## Market Timing: Why Now

1. **Biosignal Ubiquity**: Wearables penetration hit 78% in pro sports (2024)
2. **Computer Vision Maturity**: Real-time pose/micro-expression at <50ms latency
3. **Decision Fatigue**: Teams drowning in data but starving for conviction
4. **Cultural Shift**: "Intangibles" no longer dismissed as unmeasurable

## The Product: Champion Enigma Engine (CEE)

Multi-modal system that quantifies traditionally unmeasurable qualities:
- **Inputs**: Video, biosignals, game telemetry, historical patterns
- **Processing**: Visual cortex analysis + physiological decoding + psychological profiling
- **Outputs**: 8 Champion Dimensions with evidence trails and confidence bounds

**Not another analytics dashboard. It's conviction infrastructure.**

**Blaze Intelligence isn't just measuring performance. We're creating a new asset class: Conviction.**
