Critical breakages

“Live Demo” is broken. /live-demo returns an error. Fix or hide. 
Invalid URL

Many links appear to be stubs/anchors. Internal nav items don’t route to real pages; blog subpages work. Example: blog → Week 2 loads, but core menu items are anchor-only.

“96.2% prediction accuracy” vs “94.6%.” Your live page shows both numbers. Your canonical standard in repo says 94.6%. Align to one value.

SITE-REMEDIATION-COMPLETE

Cross-repo and doc findings (GitHub, Drive, Notion)

You already documented broken links, static demo data, and inconsistent metrics and proposed a canonical metrics config and quick-fix scripts. Use them.

Your deployment plan and stack choice (Astro + Cloudflare Pages + Notion + HubSpot) are sound and faster than Replit for public pages. They also outline lead capture and observability.

The integration assessment flags current state as “40% complete” and lists concrete steps to reach 90% in ~3 hours. Mirror that here.

Replit-specific fixes to ship now

Kill dead routes or create placeholders.
Implement /live-demo, /pricing, /dashboard, /privacy, /terms. Your repo scripts already copy legal pages; port those files into Replit. 

deploy-enhanced-site

Standardize metrics site-wide.
Replace all in-page numbers with a single JSON source and hydrate on load.

<script type="application/json" id="metrics">
{"prediction_accuracy":"94.6%","events_per_second":"100K+","cost_savings":"67–80%","value_identified":"$42.3M"}
</script>
<script>
const m=JSON.parse(document.getElementById('metrics').textContent);
document.querySelectorAll('[data-metric="accuracy"]').forEach(n=>n.textContent=m.prediction_accuracy);
</script>


Use your canonical config values.

Blog correctness is fine.
Keep the Week 2 article. It aligns with AP/ESPN. Add tiny footnotes with links to sources used above.

Form handling.
Wire the contact form to HubSpot (embed or API) so submissions are real. Your plan already centers HubSpot. 

Website Setup & Implementation …

Add robots.txt + sitemap.xml + 404.
Keep them static in Replit root for now.

/robots.txt → Sitemap: /sitemap.xml

/sitemap.xml → include /, /blog, /blog-cfb-week2-2025, /pricing, /contact.

Accessibility + performance.

Give all decorative icons aria-hidden="true".

Compress hero images.

Defer non-critical scripts and fonts.

Ensure focus states on buttons and links.

Minimal code diffs

Fix “Live Demo” to a working placeholder now:

<!-- add /live-demo route -->
<section id="live-demo">
  <h2>Interactive Demo (Placeholder)</h2>
  <p>Live data demo is available to trial accounts. Request access below.</p>
  <a class="btn" href="/pilot">Request Pilot Access</a>
</section>


And ensure the link targets href="#live-demo" or a real /live-demo page to avoid 404s.

Inject canonical footers and legal links:

<footer>
  <a href="/privacy">Privacy</a> • <a href="/terms">Terms</a>
</footer>

Next moves across your connected systems

GitHub. Run your existing quick-fix script and push the canonical metrics JSON so Replit can fetch it or embed it.

Notion → site content. Migrate blog posts to a Notion DB later. For Replit, keep static MD first. Your architecture doc already defines this flow.

HubSpot. Drop in tracking + forms to validate pipeline.

Canva/Dropbox. Export optimized hero assets at ≤1600px wide and WebP. Replace any oversized PNGs.

Drive. Pull “immediate action items” from your consolidation plan and reflect them in this Replit build.

Game results and AP rankings used in your Week 2 blog are correct. Keep with citations.

Metrics consistency is not. Normalize to 94.6% everywhere per your own canonical file.

UX gaps. Dead “Live Demo,” anchor menus, and missing legal pages. Patch as above.

If you want, I can produce a ready-to-paste index.html with the fixes, a /live-demo.html placeholder, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and the small metrics loader script.
