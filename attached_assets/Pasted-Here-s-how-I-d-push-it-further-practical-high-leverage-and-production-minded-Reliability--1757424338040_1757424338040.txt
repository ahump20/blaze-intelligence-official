Here’s how I’d push it further — practical, high-leverage, and production-minded.

### Reliability & performance

* **Graceful degradation:** 502/peer-closed → show cached results or a demo dataset, not a blank page. Health probe + circuit breaker per data source.
* **Hard latency budgets:** 100 ms end-to-end target split by stage (ingest/render/ML). Enforce with RUM + server spans; fail soft if over budget.
* **Client perf:** Offload heavy compute to Web Workers/WASM; throttle canvas redraws with `requestAnimationFrame` + intersection observers; reduce motion setting for low-end devices.

### Privacy, consent, compliance

* **Explicit consent flows:** Per-session consent for video/voice/biometrics; age-gating for minors; revoke + export UI.
* **Data minimization:** Default to on-device inference where possible; redact frames after feature extraction.
* **Policies in product:** Retention windows, audit logs, access reviews; publish a plain-English privacy page linked from the Coach UI.

### Model quality & safety

* **Calibration & confidence:** Show confidence bands for each signal (micro-expressions, posture, voice). Suppress low-confidence guidance by default.
* **Validation harness:** Fixed test set, drift monitor, and monthly QA so the 94.6% claim stays defensible.
* **Bias checks:** Device, lighting, skin-tone, background-noise ablations; document known failure modes in-app.

### UX & accessibility

* **Interpretability first:** Always pair scores with “why” (top features, exemplar frames, short clips).
* **Assistive design:** WCAG 2.2 AA (keyboard paths, focus rings, captions on video, reduced-motion option).
* **Coach workflows:** One-tap “Clip, Tag, Share” from any alert; session timeline with jump-to moments.

### Productization

* **Demo mode:** Synthetic athletes + prebuilt sessions so buyers can try without cameras/mics.
* **Role-based access:** Players see self; coaches see team; execs see aggregates; granular sharing links with expirations.
* **Report packs:** One-click PDF + CSV with watermark, version hash, and embedded consent status.

### Observability

* **SLOs & error budgets:** Availability, latency, data freshness; alert on budget burn.
* **Full audit trail:** Who viewed/exported data; immutable log for compliance/regulatory needs.

### Integrations

* **Data fusion:** Optional import of pitch/radar data (Statcast/TrackMan) to correlate tells with outcomes.
* **Scheduling & CRM:** Embedded booking (Calendly/Google Calendar) + CRM webhooks for leads; tags prefill report templates.

### Security

* **Tenant isolation & secrets:** Per-team namespaces; rotate keys; strict CSP; media stored encrypted with scoped URLs.
* **Kill-switch:** Remote toggle to disable capture/processing if a policy or venue disallows recording.

### Growth & content

* **Playbooks:** Short in-app tutorials (e.g., “Fix posture collapse in 3 steps”) that apply when certain patterns fire.
* **ROI dashboard:** Injury-risk deltas, development speed, and time-saved metrics tied to sessions over weeks.

### Engineering hygiene

* **Feature flags:** Safe rollout of Neural Coach sub-features (voice, AU, posture) with staged exposure.
* **Schema & exports:** Portable JSON for session exports; strict versioning to keep downstream tools compatible.

**Immediate wins (this week)**

1. Add graceful offline/demo fallback for `/coach`.
2. Ship consent + retention UI and display consent badges on exports.
3. Render confidence bars and rationale snippets for each insight.
4. Add PWA service worker + manifest for offline viewing and quick re-loads.
5. Instrument SLOs and wire error-budget alerts.

These raise trust, reduce risk, and make Neural Coach usable in the messy real world—without slowing you down.
