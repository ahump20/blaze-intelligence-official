Content to add (ready-to-paste)

Hero h1:
“Real-time sports intelligence for decisions that win.”

Subcopy:
“Under 100ms response. Predictive scouting, Digital Combine™, and NIL valuation in one platform. No hype. Just measurable outcomes.”

Proof policy excerpt:
“We publish methods, sample datasets, and error bounds. No unnamed clients. All metrics are reproducible.”

Lead form required fields:
Name, Org, Email, Sport, Level, Use-case, Consent.

Guardrails

No unverifiable claims. Gate any “trusted by” copy behind explicit, linkable evidence.

Keep secrets in server env only. Never in client bundles.

Return JSON from demo endpoints capped and cached; implement rate limiting.

If you want, I can supply the exact React/vanilla components for:

Team/Player dashboard (selectors, KPIs, sparkline)

NIL calculator

Digital Combine upload panel

Say the word and I’ll drop in production-ready components and minimal CSS.
