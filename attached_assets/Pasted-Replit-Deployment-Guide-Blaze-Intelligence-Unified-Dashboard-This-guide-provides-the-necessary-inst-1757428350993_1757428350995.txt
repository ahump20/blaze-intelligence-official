Replit Deployment Guide: Blaze Intelligence Unified Dashboard
This guide provides the necessary instructions and code for the Replit Agent to deploy the enhanced and unified Blaze Intelligence dashboard.

1. Objective
Enhance Storytelling & Factuality: Integrate more compelling narratives and verifiable data points throughout the site to increase credibility.

Implement Unique Data Visualizations: Replace generic charts with custom, eye-popping visuals that provide unique insights.

Unify All Features: Ensure all modules (Neural Coach, Digital Combine, etc.) are seamlessly integrated into a single, cohesive SPA.

Live Deployment: Provide a single, injectable HTML file for immediate implementation in the Replit environment.

2. Implementation Steps for Replit Agent
Backup Existing Files: Before injection, create a backup of the current index.html, style.css, and any relevant JavaScript files in the Replit environment.

Inject blaze-intelligence-revamped.html:

Delete the entire contents of the existing main HTML file (likely index.html).

Copy and paste the full contents of the provided blaze-intelligence-revamped.html file into the now-empty main HTML file.

Remove Obsolete Files: Delete any old, separate .css or .js files that have been consolidated into the new unified HTML file. This prevents conflicts.

Restart the Repl: Perform a full restart of the Replit environment to ensure all changes are loaded correctly.

Verify Deployment:

Open the live URL.

Confirm that the new dark-themed aesthetic is active.

Test all navigation links (Home, Neural Coach™, Digital Combine™, Pricing, About, Login) to ensure the SPA routing works without page reloads.

Check that the homepage "Cardinals Live Snapshot" is populating with data from the MLB API.

Verify that the three.js animations are running on the Home and Neural Coach pages.

3. Summary of Key Enhancements Deployed
Storytelling & Factuality:
"From the Diamond to Data Science" Narrative: The new "About" page provides a strong, authentic founder story that connects your athletic background directly to the company's mission.

Data-Backed Claims: The "Methods" link on the hero dashboard now provides a clear, concise explanation for the platform's accuracy claims, building immediate trust.

Real-Time Momentum: The "Team Momentum" metric is now a dynamic, factual representation of the Cardinals' current streak based on the last 10 days of game data, replacing a generic number with a real, insightful story.

Unique Data Visualizations:
Live Team Momentum: Instead of a simple number, the "W/L" streak format is a more intuitive and visually engaging way to represent a team's current performance trend. -   Dynamic Gauges: The Digital Combine™ now uses custom-coded, animated SVG gauges that are more visually appealing and unique than standard chart libraries.

Interactive 3D Backgrounds: The use of three.js provides a cutting-edge, interactive backdrop that subtly communicates the platform's technological sophistication.

Functional Enhancements:
Live Login & Pricing Pages: The "Login" button and "Get Started" CTAs now lead to functional, styled pages, creating complete and logical user journeys.

Unified Codebase: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within a single file, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across the platform.

This deployment will successfully transform the Blaze Intelligence site into a premium, factual, and highly engaging platform that accurately reflects your brand vision.
