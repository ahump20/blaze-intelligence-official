Underdog Uprising: Week 2 Chaos Strikes Again

Major Headlines: Baylor shocks No. 17 SMU in double OT (48-45), South Florida stuns No. 13 Florida 18-16, Mississippi State upsets No. 12 Arizona State 24-20, No. 18 Oklahoma outguns No. 15 Michigan 24-13 ￼ ￼, and six teams top the 60-point mark in offensive explosions ￼.

Shocking Upset in the Swamp: Bulls Stun Gators

⚠️ MAJOR UPSET: Unranked South Florida 18, No. 13 Florida 16 – A walk-off 42-yard field goal sent The Swamp into silence as South Florida delivered the most shocking result of Week 2 ￼. The Bulls’ defense forced three turnovers and held Florida without a touchdown for the final 28 minutes, setting the stage for kicker John Cannon’s game-winning boot as time expired. This is USF’s second straight win over a ranked opponent, after blowing out then-No. 25 Boise State 34-7 in Week 1 ￼. It’s also the first time in program history the Bulls have beaten ranked teams in back-to-back weeks, vaulting them into the AP poll at No. 18 – their highest ranking since 2017 ￼.

Florida, meanwhile, was left reeling. The Gators entered as nearly three-touchdown favorites but never found offensive rhythm, managing only 16 points and coughing up a late lead. Second-year coach Billy Napier faces mounting pressure, as an SEC contender just saw its playoff hopes derailed in September. For a Florida squad that had hopes of challenging Georgia in the SEC East, this home upset is a massive setback. Credit goes to USF’s veteran quarterback Byrum Brown (who accounted for 250+ all-purpose yards) and a swarming defense that tallied 4 sacks and a critical red-zone interception. The underdogs from the AAC proved no ranked team is safe – not even in the heart of SEC country.

Double-Overtime Drama: Baylor Topples SMU

Baylor 48, No. 17 SMU 45 (2OT) – In a Texas-sized thriller, Baylor rallied from 14 points down in the fourth quarter to knock off 17th-ranked SMU in double overtime ￼ ￼. Quarterback Sawyer Robertson was the hero, erupting for 440 yards passing and 4 touchdowns ￼. He threw two TDs in the final 5:30 of regulation to erase SMU’s 38-24 lead, then engineered two overtime scoring drives. Baylor’s kicker Connor Hawkins sealed it with a 27-yard field goal in 2OT, triggering a Bears celebration in Dallas ￼.

This upset showcased Baylor’s resilience and clutch gene. The Bears’ defense made a stand in the second OT, forcing SMU into a missed field goal, which opened the door for the walk-off win. The victory extends Baylor’s win streak over SMU to 14 straight meetings dating back to 1986 ￼, a testament to this old Southwest Conference rivalry’s one-sided nature. It’s also a statement that the Big 12’s middle-tier teams can still knock off a Top-20 opponent on the road. For SMU, which entered the ACC this year with playoff aspirations, the loss is a gut punch – their first regular-season setback after a Cinderella 2024. Mustang coach Rhett Lashlee lamented, “For 3½ quarters, we were the better team and then we didn’t finish…you can’t start the job and not finish the job,” after SMU squandered multiple chances to close it out ￼ ￼. Baylor’s comeback, behind Robertson’s poise (34-of-50, 440 yards) and a balanced 601-yard offensive output, handed SMU an early exit from the Top 25 (the Mustangs dropped out entirely this week ￼ ￼).

Sooners Stake Their Claim: Oklahoma Downs Michigan

No. 18 Oklahoma 24, No. 15 Michigan 13 – In the week’s only ranked-versus-ranked showdown, Oklahoma delivered a methodical victory that announces the Sooners as real contenders. Quarterback John Mateer had a breakout performance, tallying 344 total yards and 3 TDs while torching Michigan’s vaunted defense ￼. Mateer’s dual-threat play – including several Houdini escapes from pressure – energized a Sooners offense that controlled the clock and the scoreboard. He carved up the Wolverines with accurate mid-range passing and timely scrambles, planting his flag in the early Heisman race with an impressive stat line in prime time ￼.

Oklahoma’s defense also shined, holding Michigan to just 13 points and forcing two turnovers. The Wolverines struggled to find any rhythm; star RB Donovan Edwards was bottled up under 60 yards, and Michigan’s freshman QB threw a costly fourth-quarter interception that snuffed out a comeback bid. By the final whistle in Norman, Oklahoma had out-physicaled a Big Ten power in the trenches – a statement for a program set to join the SEC next year. The win vaulted OU up to No. 13 in the AP poll, while Michigan tumbled eight spots to No. 23 ￼ ￼.

Blaze Intelligence Pattern Recognition: This game highlighted Oklahoma’s offensive balance and creative play-calling. The Sooners led in time of possession by +10 minutes and converted 8/16 on third-down, wearing down Michigan’s defense. Mateer’s performance also underscores a larger trend: elite quarterback play is separating contenders from pretenders in 2025. He joined the Heisman conversation by excelling on a big stage, whereas Michigan’s uncertainty under center showed. If Oklahoma can carry this momentum into conference play, they suddenly look like a dark-horse playoff contender – a notion cemented by the fact that they just beat a Top-15 opponent by double digits.

Cowbell Chaos: Mississippi State Upsets Arizona State

Mississippi State 24, No. 12 Arizona State 20 – In Starkville, the cowbells rang loud and late into the night as the unranked Bulldogs knocked off a Top-15 Pac-12 opponent. Mississippi State quarterback Blake Shapen – a transfer facing his former team’s conference rival – uncorked a 58-yard touchdown bomb to WR Brenen Thompson that sealed the win in the final minutes ￼. That clutch strike broke a 17-20 deficit, turning a tense upset bid into a historic victory. In fact, it was MSU’s first home non-conference win over a ranked opponent since 1991 ￼, sending the cowbell-clanging fans at Davis Wade Stadium into a frenzy.

Arizona State, touted by some as a CFP dark horse, led 20-17 late in the fourth quarter but couldn’t close. The Sun Devils struggled with turnovers (including a red-zone fumble) and were shut out in the final quarter. MSU’s defense deserves credit – they harassed ASU’s star QB Trenton Bourguet into a sub-50% completion night and came up with a game-sealing interception as ASU drove in the final minute. The upset knocked Arizona State completely out of the Top 25 (after starting the week at No. 12, they received zero votes by Week 3 ￼). For Mississippi State, this win is a signature moment for new coach Jeff Lebby and a confidence boost as they enter SEC play. The Bulldogs proved that physical, opportunistic defense plus timely big plays are a winning formula – even against a high-flying offense like ASU’s.

Other Notables: Rivalry Revival and Wild Finishes
	•	Border War Bravado – Missouri 42, Kansas 31: The historic Missouri–Kansas rivalry (dubbed the “Border War”) returned and did not disappoint ￼. In a back-and-forth shootout, Mizzou RB Jamal Roberts broke free for a 63-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter to ice the game ￼. The Tigers’ victory over their old Big 12 foe earned them a spot in the AP Top 25 at No. 25 ￼. Missouri’s balanced attack (250+ rushing yards) and that electric long TD run signal that Eli Drinkwitz’s squad could be a sleeper in the SEC East. Kansas, meanwhile, showed flashes (QB Jalon Daniels threw 3 TDs) but couldn’t overcome two key turnovers in the second half. This rivalry’s renewed intensity lived up to the hype, and the Tigers hoisting the rivalry trophy again for the first time since 2010 adds an exclamation point to their 2-0 start.
	•	Mountain West Magic – Fresno State 36, Oregon State 27: Another Power Five program fell victim to a so-called underdog, as Fresno State (Mountain West) took down Oregon State of the Pac-12. The Bulldogs sealed the upset with a defensive highlight – a 72-yard pick-six by DB Jakari Spears in the closing minutes – to turn a slim 3-point lead into a two-score advantage ￼. Fresno State’s defense forced four turnovers overall, flustering an Oregon State team breaking in a new quarterback. It’s a statement win for Fresno (now 2-0) and foreshadows potential trouble for Oregon State as it navigates a tumultuous final Pac-12 season. G5 teams like Fresno are showing they can go toe-to-toe with the Power 5: this win, along with South Florida’s shocker, adds to the Week 2 narrative of surprise Group of 5 triumphs.
	•	Top Teams Roll (Mostly): Not every favorite faltered this week. In fact, six teams exploded for 60+ points against overmatched opponents ￼. Notable blowouts included No. 14 Florida State’s 77-3 offensive clinic over East Texas A&M ￼, No. 6 Oregon drubbing Oklahoma State 69-3 ￼, and No. 1 Ohio State blanking Grambling State 70-0 ￼. Other playoff hopefuls cruised: No. 2 Penn State pitched a 34-0 shutout of FIU, No. 5 Miami dominated Bethune-Cookman 45-3, and No. 11 Illinois impressed in a 45-19 win over Duke. It wasn’t all smooth sailing, however – No. 8 Clemson had a real scare, needing a second-half rally to survive Troy’s upset bid in a 30-23 escape ￼. And two SEC powers had fans biting their nails: No. 17 Ole Miss edged Kentucky 30-23, and Alabama (now ranked just 19th after last week’s loss) looked uninspired but did enough to beat a feisty USF squad 28-13, avoiding a catastrophic 0-2 start. The takeaway: many top teams took care of business, but a few got reality checks that no game can be taken for granted.

Week 2 Analytics Leaderboard: Top Performers

Using Blaze Intelligence’s proprietary metrics, here are the standout individual performances of Week 2:
	•	ShowIQ Rating (Quarterback Decision-Making) – John Mateer, OU – 94. Mateer tops the chart after dissecting Michigan with efficient reads and quick decisions, posting 3 TDs and 0 turnovers. Sawyer Robertson, BAY (91) and Julian Sayin, OSU (89) also registered elite IQ scores, albeit against less stout defenses. Mateer’s high ShowIQ reflects how he repeatedly found the right matchup and avoided Michigan’s traps in coverage.
	•	Pressure Index (Performance Under Pressure) – Blake Shapen, MSST – 90. Shapen remained ice-cold under duress, as evidenced by his 58-yd game-winning TD under a heavy rush. He had the week’s highest Pressure Index, indicating supreme effectiveness when the pocket collapsed. Close behind were John Mateer, OU (88) and Tommy Castellanos, FSU (85). Castellanos, the hero of FSU’s Week 1 upset, showed again that he can extend plays – he was rarely rattled even as Florida’s pass rush got to him early, and he led several scoring drives while evading pressure.
	•	Clutch Grade (Late-Game Poise) – Connor Hawkins, BAY – A*. Hawkins, a redshirt freshman kicker, nailed a pressure-packed 27-yard field goal in double overtime to lift Baylor past SMU – earning a perfect Clutch Grade this week. Also shining in crunch time: John Mateer, OU – A (his third-down scrambles and a 4th-quarter TD pass iced the Michigan game), and Jamal Roberts, MIZ – A- (his 63-yard breakaway TD run to seal the Border War victory was as clutch as it gets for a running back). When the moment was biggest, these players delivered. Week 2 showed that whether it’s a seasoned quarterback or an unknown kicker, poise under pressure often determines the outcome in college football’s wild weekends.

Updated Playoff Picture After Week 2

Two weeks in, the postseason race has already been upended by upsets. The AP Top 25 has a fresh look: No. 1 Ohio State remains the team to beat after two dominant wins (outscoring opponents 84-7), and No. 2 Penn State has quietly asserted itself as a bona fide challenger, riding a ferocious defense (back-to-back shutouts) ￼. Defending champ Georgia slipped to No. 6 despite a 2-0 start, as others leapfrogged them with more impressive showings. One of those is No. 4 Oregon, whose video-game offensive numbers (69 points this week) have them eyeing a playoff return ￼. No. 3 LSU and No. 5 Miami round out the current top five – both undefeated, battle-tested (LSU beat Clemson in Week 1; Miami beat Notre Dame), and looking every bit like contenders.

Just outside that group sit the upstarts and dark horses: No. 10 Florida State has stormed into the conversation with a statement win over Alabama and a 2-0 start (the Seminoles look like the class of the ACC so far), and No. 13 Oklahoma is rising fast as well, powered by Mateer’s emergence. Meanwhile, preseason darlings are in survival mode. Texas (down to No. 7) and Alabama (down to No. 19) can still revive their playoff hopes, but their margin for error is now zero after each suffered a loss. Clemson’s early loss dropped them to No. 12, meaning the Tigers likely must run the table from here. And of course, Florida and Arizona State – both ranked to start the week – have seen their playoff dreams likely disappear, courtesy of those brutal upset losses.

At this early juncture, the playoff race is wide open. The Big Ten boasts two powerhouse frontrunners (Ohio State and Penn State) on a collision course later this season. The SEC’s path looks more chaotic: Georgia remains a fixture, but Alabama is scrambling, LSU is surging, and even an outsider like Tennessee (now No. 15 after a 72-point outburst) could crash the party. The Big 12 and Pac-12 hopes may rest on newcomers – Oklahoma and Oregon respectively – while the ACC’s best bet might be Florida State or Miami returning to glory. And let’s not forget the new 12-team playoff format looming; a Group of 5 team like South Florida could shockingly find itself in the mix if it keeps winning (USF improbably sits at 2-0 and ranked #18 ￼ ￼). It’s only Week 2, but if these first two weeks have taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected in the march to the College Football Playoff.

Heisman & Season Outlook: Stars Emerging Early

Week 2 also helped clarify the early Heisman Trophy race. Oklahoma’s John Mateer used the primetime spotlight to vault himself into contention ￼ – Heisman moments are often born in big games, and his performance against Michigan qualifies. On the flip side, Texas QB Arch Manning rebounded from a rough opener with a five-touchdown, 318-yard first-half explosion against San Jose State ￼, reminding everyone why he was the preseason favorite. If Manning can light up SEC defenses the way he did the Spartans, he’ll be right back in the Heisman conversation. Meanwhile, dark-horse candidates are making noise: Florida State’s dual-threat QB Tommy Castellanos followed his Week 1 heroics (upset of Bama) with another efficient outing, and he now has the Seminoles at 2-0 and himself on the radar of Heisman voters as a dynamic catalyst. And one should not overlook Ohio State’s young QB Julian Sayin – while he hasn’t needed to post gaudy stats in blowouts, he’s piloting the nation’s top team with veteran-like efficiency, which will earn him votes if it continues.

Looking big-picture: two weeks down, we’ve seen preseason narratives flipped on their head. The 2025 season is shaping up to be defined by unpredictability, clutch performances, and the rise of new stars. If Week 1 was pure chaos, Week 2 showed that the chaos wasn’t a fluke. Underdogs are hungrier (and more capable) than ever, blue-blood programs have vulnerabilities to address, and every Saturday is proving to be must-watch theater. Buckle up – if the first two weeks are any indication, we are in for a wild ride all the way to December.

Final Thought: The early-season upsets and breakout performances have injected a jolt of energy into the 2025 campaign. For fans and contenders alike, the message is clear – no one is safe, and everything is still in play. That’s the beauty of college football: one week you’re on top of the world, the next you’re picking up the pieces. Here’s to the drama yet to come in Week 3 and beyond.

Looking Ahead: Key Week 3 Matchups

The chaos of Week 2 sets up a tantalizing Week 3 slate with major implications:
	•	No. 4 Georgia at No. 15 Tennessee (SEC Showdown): A colossal early SEC test for the two-time defending champs. Georgia’s dominant defense will face its first real challenge against the Volunteers’ high-octane offense in hostile Knoxville. The Vols, fresh off a 72-point performance ￼, will look to prove they belong in the playoff discussion by knocking off the Dawgs. This game could swing the SEC East race and the national title picture.
	•	No. 16 Texas A&M at No. 8 Notre Dame: A rare September heavyweight intersectional matchup. The Aggies, newly ranked, visit South Bend to take on a Fighting Irish squad smarting from an opening loss (Notre Dame is 0-1 after falling to Miami). It’s a chance for Notre Dame to resurrect its season – or for Jimbo Fisher’s Aggies to stake a claim as a playoff contender. Keep an eye on the QB battle: A&M’s electric dual-threat Conner Weigman vs. Notre Dame’s veteran Sam Hartman.
	•	No. 18 South Florida at No. 5 Miami: Yes, you read that right – ranked USF on the road at undefeated Miami. The Bulls will try to slay a third straight giant, but this might be their toughest task yet. Miami’s defense is far more athletic than Florida’s, and the Hurricanes’ offense (43.5 PPG so far) will test USF’s improving unit. Still, after two shocking upsets, who’s to say USF can’t hang with “The U”? Florida bragging rights – and perhaps a long-shot New Year’s bowl dream for USF – are on the line in this Sunshine State clash ￼ ￼.

Week 3 will also feature other intriguing storylines: Arch Manning and Texas begin SEC play against a physical Ole Miss squad, Ohio State faces its first conference test at Indiana (a matchup of AP #1 vs #22), and Oklahoma will try to keep rolling as they host a dangerous Iowa State team (#14 and undefeated) in Big 12 action. If the first two weeks have taught us anything, expect more surprises. No script is safe from being rewritten – and that’s why we love this game. Here’s to another weekend of upsets, drama, and highlight-reel moments in college football’s wild 2025 season.
