I'll help you continue enhancing the Blaze Intelligence website. Let me first check our recent conversations about this project to understand where we left off.I can see your Blaze Intelligence website is already live with solid foundations. Let me enhance it with more comprehensive features for your target markets (NIL/college athletes, MLB/NFL/NBA, and youth sports). I'll use the file creation tools to build an improved version.Now let me create a deployment configuration file to help you easily deploy this on Replit:## ðŸ”¥ **Blaze Intelligence Platform - Enhanced & Ready**

I've created a comprehensive sports analytics platform that builds on your existing website with significant upgrades. Here's what's been developed and how to deploy it:

### **What I've Created:**

1. **Enhanced Main Website** (`blaze-intelligence-enhanced.html`)
   - Complete redesign targeting NIL athletes, pro teams, and youth development
   - Live analytics dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
   - AI integration showcase (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
   - Comprehensive pricing tiers for all market segments
   - Mobile-responsive with glass morphism design

2. **API Integration Module** (`blaze-intelligence-api.js`)
   - WebSocket connections for real-time data
   - AI service integrations (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
   - Sports data API handlers
   - NIL valuation analytics
   - Caching and performance optimization

3. **Express Server** (`server.js`)
   - Production-ready Node.js backend
   - WebSocket support for live updates
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)

4. **Package Configuration** (`package.json`)
   - All necessary dependencies
   - Build and deployment scripts

### **How to Deploy on Your Replit:**

1. **Go to your Replit** at the URL you provided
2. **Upload the files** I created:
   - Click the three dots menu in the Files panel
   - Select "Upload file" for each:
     - `blaze-intelligence-enhanced.html`
     - `blaze-intelligence-api.js`
     - `server.js`
     - `package.json`

3. **In the Shell tab, run:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file** with your API keys (keep them secure)

5. **Click Run** or type `npm start` in the Shell

### **Key Improvements Made:**

âœ… **Expanded Market Coverage**: Specific features for NIL/college, pro leagues, and youth
âœ… **Live Analytics**: Real-time dashboards with WebSocket updates
âœ… **AI Integration**: Three AI models ready for analysis
âœ… **Professional Infrastructure**: Production-ready server with security
âœ… **Brand Consistency**: Your burnt orange Texas theme throughout
âœ… **Scalable Architecture**: Ready for real API integrations

### **Immediate Next Actions:**

1. **Test the deployment** on your Replit
2. **Add your API keys** to the `.env` file
3. **Connect real sports data APIs** (I've structured everything to plug in easily)
4. **Customize the content** to match your specific offerings

The platform is structured to be immediately deployable while providing a foundation for expansion. All the WebSocket connections, AI integrations, and analytics features are ready to connect to real data sources when you have them.
