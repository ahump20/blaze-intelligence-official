  micro-expressions and body language for character assessment appears to
  be ahead of current market offerings, which primarily focus on
  performance metrics alone.

> looking at the features and embedded datasets and links to resources of 
  stats and databases (i.e. links to Baseballreference.com or 
  profootballfocus.com) available on 
  https://a4dc795e.blaze-intelligence.pages.dev/ ; how do you think we can 
  organize and build something similar as an extension to the Blaze 
  Intelligence platform and subdomains 
  https://003fa38a-b8b1-42db-8ebb-5c5e3e6dd5c8.spock.prod.repl.run/ ? also 
  try using your sportsradar APIs in your secret keys in order to inject 
  real actual data for MLB, NCAA football, and NFL

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to:
  1. Look at features and embedded datasets/links on 
  https://a4dc795e.blaze-intelligence.pages.dev/
  2. Suggest how to organize and build something similar as an extension to 
  their Blaze Intelligence platform
  3. Use SportsRadar APIs from my secret keys to inject real MLB, NCAA 
  football, and NFL data

  First, I should fetch and analyze the content from the provided URL to 
  understand what features and datasets are available there.

  Then I should look for any SportsRadar API keys in the environment or 
  configuration that I can use.

  Finally, I should create a plan for extending their platform with similar 
  features and real data integration.

⏺ I'll analyze the features on your Blaze Intelligence Pages deployment
  and help you organize a similar extension with real data integration
  using SportsRadar APIs.

✻ Thinking…

  The user typed "/output-style" which appears to be asking me to display 
  information about my current output style or perhaps change it. Let me check
   what output style I'm currently using and respond appropriately.

⏺ output-style-setup(Check current output style)
  ⎿  Done (7 tool uses · 29.0k tokens · 35.7s)                           

✻ Thinking…

  The user typed "/output-style" which triggered the output-style-setup agent 
  to check their configured output styles. The agent found 9 configured styles
   and provided information about them. 

  Now I should continue with the tasks at hand. Looking at the todo list, I've
   completed the live-sports-scoreboard-api integration, so I should update 
  that and continue with the remaining tasks.

✻ Thinking…

  I should now configure the SportsRadar API keys and add the newly created 
  integrations to the main index.html file. Let me update the index.html to 
  include the new scripts and add sections for the scoreboard widgets.

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 2 additions

  I found the Grit Index section. Now let me add the live scoreboard sections 
  and team intelligence cards section after the Grit Index section. Let me 
  find what comes after the grit-index section to insert the new sections 
  properly.

⏺ Search(pattern: "</section>.*footer", path: "index.html", output_mode:

  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see the structure now. The grit-index section ends and the footer 
  begins at line 635. I should insert the new sections (live scoreboards and 
  team intelligence cards) before the footer but after the grit-index section.
   Let me do that now.
