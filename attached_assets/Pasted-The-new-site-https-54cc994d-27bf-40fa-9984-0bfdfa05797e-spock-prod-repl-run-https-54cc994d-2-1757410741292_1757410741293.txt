The new site ([https://54cc994d-27bf-40fa-9984-0bfdfa05797e.spock.prod.repl.run/](https://54cc994d-27bf-40fa-9984-0bfdfa05797e.spock.prod.repl.run/)) is a significant step up from the prior version.  The dark‑theme, burnt‑orange palette and particle backgrounds immediately convey a polished, premium product.  The hero section clearly states the value proposition (“Transform Data Into Championships”) and uses compelling copy to invite action.  Navigation is richer – separate sections for **Analytics**, **Features**, **AI Intelligence**, **Dashboard**, **Manifesto** and **Pilot** suggest a comprehensive platform.  The league filter in the top‑right allows visitors to toggle between College Football, NFL and MLB data.

**What’s working well**

* **Professional design and brand consistency.**  The layout, typography and micro‑interactions feel cohesive and high‑end; the new site does a better job of balancing visuals with text.  Section headers (“Real‑Time Performance Intelligence”, “Championship‑Level Tools”, “Built for Winners”) are bold and memorable.  The use of icons and cards to present features such as *real‑time processing*, *AI‑powered predictions* and *custom dashboards* is effective.
* **Product breadth showcased.**  New interactive elements illustrate the platform’s scope: a **Digital Combine™ demo** that lets visitors drag and drop a clip for biomechanical analysis, an **NIL Valuation Engine** that calculates name‑image‑likeness value based on sport, rankings and followers, and an **AI Intelligence** section offering team analysis and championship probability calculators with clear pricing tiers (\$99/month and \$299/month).  These tools differentiate Blaze from generic dashboards.
* **Transparent pricing.**  The premium plan card lists prices and benefits clearly, which builds trust.
* **Deeper storytelling.**  The “Built for Winners” section explains Blaze’s origin and emphasizes that the platform quantifies intangibles.

**Areas that still need attention**

1. **Data and live metrics remain placeholders.**  Key stats (players analyzed, prediction accuracy, live games, data points) show zeros, and many chart cards (Player Performance Index, Team Efficiency Metrics) are blank.  If the APIs aren’t yet hooked up, label the sections as “Demo Mode” to manage expectations.  Visitors will lose trust if “Real‑Time Performance Intelligence” leads to empty boxes.
2. **Inconsistent performance claims.**  The hero section on the previous version touts 94.6 % prediction accuracy; the new “AI‑Powered Predictions” card claims 96.2 %.  These numbers require a **methods and definitions** link to explain how the metrics are calculated and to reconcile discrepancies.
3. **Interactive dashboards need working data.**  The “Real‑Time Sports Dashboard” includes filters for MLB/NFL/College Football and drop‑downs to select teams and players, but the lists don’t populate and nothing happens when you click “Analyze Team”.  The “Championship Analytics Dashboard” at the bottom also has blank charts.  Populate these with sample team/league data (even static, if live feeds aren’t ready).
4. **Add social proof and case studies.**  No logos or testimonials appear on the page.  For an enterprise analytics platform, quotes from coaches or program directors and a few case studies (even anonymized) will make a huge difference.
5. **Clarify product structure and funnel.**  There are many sections (AI Intelligence, Dashboard, Pilot, Manifesto, NIL Calculator, CFB Blog) but no clear call‑to‑action flow.  Consider guiding visitors through a structured journey (e.g. *Learn → Demo → Pricing → Contact*).  Also, the blog link is small and easily missed; blog content can boost credibility.
6. **Accessibility and performance.**  The heavy use of dark backgrounds and small orange text may be hard to read for some.  Provide sufficient contrast and consider a light theme toggle.  Ensure animations are optimized for slower devices.

**Overall verdict**

This version feels like a sophisticated, feature‑rich sports‑analytics platform.  It does an excellent job of showcasing Blaze’s vision and differentiators.  To convert visitors, however, the site needs real data flowing through its dashboards, clear documentation of performance metrics, and evidence of customer success.  Addressing those gaps – plus adding social proof and tidying the user journey – will help the polished design translate into actual business impact.
