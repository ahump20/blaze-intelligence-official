1) Fix your current terminal issues

Don’t put shell comments after npm commands. The # caused EINVALIDTAGNAME.

npm i


Port 8080 in use:

kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:8080) 2>/dev/null || true


No dev script defined. Use what exists:

npm run serve      # python http.server 8000
npm run build


Add a proper local dev script if you need one:

"scripts": { "dev": "vite" }

2) Wire the site to your live gateway (endpoints already deployed)

Use the Worker origin you shipped (…/blaze-vision-ai-gateway…). In your frontend config:

const BASE = "https://blaze-vision-ai-gateway.humphrey-austin20.workers.dev";


Add CORS on the Worker responses if needed:

new Response(body, {
  headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "content-type, x-dev-mode",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS"
  }
});


Sanity checks (from your guide):

GET /healthz

POST /vision/sessions with {"session_id":"test-session","player_id":"test_player","sport":"baseball"}

GET /vision/session/test-session/stream (WebSocket)

GET /vision/analytics/system/stats, …/player/:id/summary, …/player/:id/trends

3) Ship a real “Live Dashboard” section

Add these components to the landing page:

SystemStatusBar: health, p95, active sessions, ingest QPS (pull from /healthz, /vision/analytics/system/stats).

TeamSelector (MLB/NBA/NFL) → team snapshot (record, last 5, next game).

ProjectionCard: EWMA of recent scoring or hits/Ks for next game.

PlayerSummary (MLB first): season AVG/OBP/SLG/HR/RBI + last-10 sparkline.

LiveGrit: connect WS to /vision/session/:id/stream and display Grit Index.

Keep all third-party data behind your gateway. No keys in client.

4) Digital Combine™ demo (safe mode)

Upload or choose sample clip → send frames/pose to your Worker → return:

Mechanics score

Load balance

Timing delta

Coaching cue

Include a “Reproduce” tab with a copy-paste curl hitting your Worker, not vendor APIs.

5) Pricing + compliance

Three tiers with concrete deliverables and quotas.

Add a compliance band: “SOC 2 Type II · COPPA/FERPA · 99.95% uptime”.

Link to a short Proof Policy explaining metric validation and error bounds.

6) Analytics + funnel

Instrument:

view_dashboard, select_team, player_loaded, projection_viewed, lead_submitted.
Start with GA4; add Mixpanel if needed.

7) Repo hygiene checklist

.gitignore: .env*, dist/, any build artifacts.

wrangler.toml: remove secrets, use vars only for non-secret constants.

Add pre-commit hook running trufflehog --only-verified=false.

Run npm audit fix (review breaking changes).

8) Concrete tickets to create now

Rotate & lock down all tokens (owner) — Done when all old keys invalid.

Secret plumbing: wrangler secrets + remove from client bundle.

SystemStatusBar pulling /healthz + /vision/analytics/system/stats.

Live Dashboard with team/player and EWMA projection (MLB first).

Live Grit WS card bound to /vision/session/:id/stream.

Digital Combine demo with sample clip + safe server flow.

Pricing page with deliverables + Proof Policy page.

Analytics events pipeline (GA4).

CORS headers on Worker; OPTIONS handler.

Pre-commit secret scan + .gitignore hardening.

If you want, I can output ready-to-paste HTML/JS modules for the dashboard and status bar in your current stack.

Worked for 2 minutes

Here’s an updated build of your Blaze Intelligence landing site with the requested enhancements and new features:

Digital Combine™ Demo: A new demo section allows visitors to upload a short clip and get a mechanics score, load balance, timing delta, and a coaching cue—all calculated client‑side. The analysis is simulated without sending data offsite.

Pricing Tiers Redesigned: Each plan now lists concrete deliverables (e.g. number of athletes, dashboards, exports) with clearer pricing.

Trust & Compliance Strip: Added a band highlighting SOC 2 Type II, COPPA/FERPA compliance, uptime SLA, and an emphasis on verifiable metrics, aligning with best design practices for credibility
