## A. What changes where (page map → modules)

| Page / Section                       | Module (new or upgraded)                                                                        | Primary user value                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hero**                             | **Pressure Stream** (D3 canvas) — live Win Prob + Pressure glow, with event markers             | Tells coaches and execs where the game truly swung; one glance narrative of momentum        |
| **Live Intelligence**                | **Pressure Heatmap** (Canvas/WebGL) + **Clutch Rings KPI** (Three.js)                           | Spatial pressure & tempo hotspots + proof KPIs (accuracy, latency) for investor credibility |
| **Neural Coach™ / Combine™**         | **Biomech Pose Overlay** (canvas) + **Biometric micro-panel** (HR/HRV trend)                    | Real-time skill cues + fatigue flags for athletes and trainers                              |
| **Team Chemistry**                   | **Dynamic Network Graph** (vis.js/sigma.js) + **Familiarity Index**                             | Shows lineup synergies/pass lanes; actionable substitution insights                         |
| **Ghost Play** (new, hero-level 3-D) | 3-D reconstructions of key plays with overlays (passing lanes/court control)                    | Analyst-grade review and investor demo that’s novel yet purposeful                          |
| **NIL Engine**                       | **NIL Ribbon** (3-D parametric ribbon) — length/twist/spikes map to followers/engagement/awards | A unique, visual “shape of marketability” for recruiting & brand teams                      |
| **Reports**                          | One-click PDF/CSV for **Clutch Splits**, **EoCC**, **Chemistry Deltas**, **NIL**                | Investor decks & coach packets; all assets embedded and branded                             |

All visuals adhere to the **Bloomberg-meets-sports** aesthetic, dark-mode first, with burnt-orange and cardinal-blue accents; clarity > spectacle; one hero-quality 3-D per page is enough.&#x20;

---

## B. Data contracts (API-ready now; simulated data OK)

> The schema mirrors leading providers so you can swap to Sportradar/Stats Perform later with minimal code churn.&#x20;

```ts
// Live pressure stream (SSE or WS)
type PressureTick = {
  t: number;                   // epoch ms
  wp: number;                  // win probability [0..1]
  pressure: number;            // leverage-based pressure [0..1]
  event?: { code: string; label: string; team: string; playerId?: string };
};

// Heatmap (bin-level)
type PressureHeatMap = {
  court: "nba" | "nfl" | "mlb" | "cfb";
  bins: Array<{ x: number; y: number; pressure: number; count: number }>; // x,y in [-1..1]
};

// Chemistry & familiarity
type ChemistryEdge = { from: string; to: string; weight: number; eff: number };
type FamiliarityIndex = { pair: [string,string]; minutes: number; deltaEff: number };

// Biometric micro-panel (athlete consented)
type Biometrics = { ts: number; hr: number; hrv?: number; load?: number };

// Scouting/EoCC (basketball example)
type ClutchSplits = {
  playerId: string; name: string;
  effHighP: number; effLowP: number;  // efficiencies under high/low pressure
  eocc: number;                       // Estimation of Clutch Competency (computed)  // :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
};
```

> During staging, generate **synthetic** ticks matching this shape (including extreme moments) so the site breathes like real data; later, drop in live adapters.&#x20;

## C. Visual modules (novel, but decision-focused)

### 1) Pressure Stream (D3 Canvas; 60 fps)

* **Why**: coaches see inflection points instantly; execs see a credible, investor-grade narrative of momentum.
* **How**: win-prob line + pressure glow; markers on **high-leverage** events; brushed zoom; scrubbable timeline.
* **Novelty**: pressure glow is weighted by leverage, not just frequency; the area literally “burns” when moments matter.

> Implement with D3 canvas (not SVG) for sustained 60 fps updates; keep event annotations short and factual.&#x20;

### 2) Pressure Heatmap (Canvas→WebGL)

* **Why**: spatial pressure & tempo for real coaching decisions.
* **How**: glowing hexbins where **brightness ∝ pressure × event count**; deck.gl or PixiJS if bins explode.
* **Novelty**: toggles between **field control** (Voronoi overlay) and **pressure** to expose where momentum actually shifts.

> Use GPU when bins >10k (Pixi/Deck.gl) as recommended in the GPU stack brief.&#x20;

### 3) Clutch Rings (Three.js KPI)

* 2 torus arcs for **accuracy** & **latency** rotating subtly—hero-quality but compact; shows your system reliability at a glance.

### 4) NIL Ribbon (Three.js parametric)

* **Length** maps to log(followers), **twist** to engagement, **spikes** to awards; a unique, memorable NIL readout.

### 5) Biomech Pose Overlay (canvas)

* Smoothed joints & bones glow under **strain**; toggles to show **fatigue** or **flow/clutch** cues (athlete-friendly).
* Privacy by design; nothing stored without consent.

### 6) Dynamic Chemistry Graph (vis.js/sigma.js)

* Real-time pass/assist edges; **Familiarity Index** tooltips; lineup simulation: “what if we sub Player X?” → projected efficiency delta.&#x20;

### 7) Ghost Play (Three.js hero)

* 3-D replay with overlays (passing lanes, court control); camera presets (sky/sideline/first-person).
* **Physics core** in WebAssembly for smooth 60 fps on laptops; overlays toggleable to remain analyst-friendly.&#x20;

---

## D. Analytics engine upgrades

### The Pressure Principle → **Pressure Spectrum** (continuous)

* Leverage-driven pressure time-series (not binary “clutch”); **pressure waves** cascade through plays and amplify subsequent moments.&#x20;

### Trinity of Pressure Performance → **Quantified Athlete**

* Fuse **Physiological Resilience** (HRV, VO₂, recovery), **Psychological Fortitude** (MTI, AEQ, CD-RISC, flow vs clutch), and **Tactical Execution** (EoCC) into one scouting pane with drill-downs per domain.&#x20;

### Momentum Engine (Bayesian + XGBoost + Sequence model)

* Probabilistic baseline (Bayes) + non-linear accuracy (XGBoost) + temporal context (LSTM/Transformer).
* Output feeds **Pressure Stream** and the ghost-play narrative line; compute **in browser** where possible via TensorFlow\.js for zero-latency feel.&#x20;

---

## E. Investor-grade UX rules (enforced)

* **Desktop-first** layout for war-rooms; mobile shows summaries; load in \~3 s, sustain 60 fps interactions.&#x20;
* **Dark-mode default**, limited palette, Texas accent colors; **no rainbow pies**.&#x20;
* Animations serve comprehension (focus/transition), not spectacle.&#x20;

---

## F. Build checklist (two-week sprints)

**Sprint 1 – Pressure core**

* Implement `/api/game/pressure-stream`, `/api/game/pressure-heatmap`.
* Ship **Pressure Stream** + **KPI rings**; real or synthetic ticks (same schema).
* Budgets: TTFV ≤ 3 s; stream at 20 Hz; CPU ≤ 30%; memory ≤ 100 MB.

**Sprint 2 – Chemistry & NIL**

* Familiarity Index calc + **Dynamic Chemistry** graph.
* **NIL Ribbon** wired to form; export NIL worksheet (CSV/PDF).

**Sprint 3 – Quantified Athlete pane**

* Biometrics micro-panel (HR & HRV trend), privacy gates & consent logs.
* Clutch splits card with **EoCC** and **Δ efficiency** under high vs low pressure.&#x20;

**Sprint 4 – Ghost Play + polish**

* Prototype play parser → 3-D reconstruction; add passing lanes/court-control overlays; wasm physics core.
* Accessibility pass; reduced motion fallback; on-page **GIF/WEBM** exporter for clips.

## G. Code drop-ins (ready to paste)

**Pressure Stream (D3 canvas, live SSE)**

```html
<section id="pressureStream" class="viz" style="height:38vh"></section>
<script type="module">
import * as d3 from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/d3@7';
const el=document.querySelector('#pressureStream'), W=el.clientWidth, H=el.clientHeight, M={t:24,r:28,b:26,l:40};
const cvs=d3.select(el).append('canvas').attr('width',W).attr('height',H).node(), ctx=cvs.getContext('2d');
const x=d3.scaleTime().range([M.l,W-M.r]), y=d3.scaleLinear().domain([0,1]).range([H-M.b,M.t]); let data=[];
const src=new EventSource('/api/game/pressure-stream');
src.onmessage=e=>{ const t=JSON.parse(e.data); data.push(t); const mx=d3.max(data,d=>d.t), mn=mx-1000*60*18; data=data.filter(d=>d.t>=mn); x.domain([mn,mx]); draw(); };
function draw(){ ctx.clearRect(0,0,W,H);
  // pressure glow
  const grd=ctx.createLinearGradient(0,M.t,0,H-M.b); grd.addColorStop(0,'rgba(191,87,0,.25)'); grd.addColorStop(1,'rgba(155,203,235,.08)'); ctx.fillStyle=grd;
  ctx.beginPath(); ctx.moveTo(x(data[0]?.t||0), y(0)); data.forEach(d=>ctx.lineTo(x(d.t), y(d.pressure))); ctx.lineTo(x(data[data.length-1]?.t||0), y(0)); ctx.fill();
  // win prob line
  ctx.strokeStyle='#9BCBEB'; ctx.lineWidth=2; ctx.beginPath(); data.forEach((d,i)=>{ const X=x(d.t), Y=y(d.wp); i?ctx.lineTo(X,Y):ctx.moveTo(X,Y); }); ctx.stroke();
  // events
  ctx.fillStyle='#BF5700'; data.filter(d=>d.event).forEach(d=>{ ctx.beginPath(); ctx.arc(x(d.t), y(d.wp), 3, 0, 2*Math.PI); ctx.fill(); });
}
</script>
```

**Chemistry Graph (vis.js) – live update handler**

```js
function handleGameEvent(evt){ // evt: SUCCESSFUL_PASS or SUBSTITUTION
  if(evt.type==='SUCCESSFUL_PASS'){
    const id=`${evt.from}-${evt.to}`, e=edges.get(id);
    e ? edges.update({id,value:e.value+1,title:`${e.value+1} successful passes`})
      : edges.add({id,from:evt.from,to:evt.to,value:1,title:'1 successful pass'});
  } else if(evt.type==='SUBSTITUTION'){ nodes.remove({id:evt.out}); nodes.add({id:evt.in,label:evt.name,group:'bench'}); }
}
```

**NIL Ribbon (Three.js) – update hook**

```js
// after form submit:
updateNILRibbon(+followers.value, +engagement.value/100, +awards.value);
```

**Pose overlay – draw each frame**

```js
// drawPose(keypoints) // feed from MediaPipe/OpenPose
```

> For 3-D modules and GPU stack, follow the hybrid Canvas/WebGL guidance and performance rules in the visuals brief (GPU-accelerated rendering, LOD systems, texture atlasing, and WebSocket/SSE streaming) to keep 60 fps at scale.&#x20;

---

## H. Acceptance criteria (non-negotiable)

* **Narrative clarity**: coaches and execs can answer “what changed the game?” in ≤10 s using Pressure Stream + Heatmap.
* **Actionability**: lineup suggestion based on Chemistry + Δ efficiency appears in ≤3 s after a substitution.
* **Investor credibility**: accuracy & latency KPIs visible above the fold; performance budget met (TTFV ≤ 3 s, 60 fps).
* **Privacy**: biometrics gated behind explicit consent; no persistence without opt-in.
* **Exportability**: every view can export a high-res PNG/PDF or a 6–8 s WEBM clip for decks.
* **API-ready**: switch from simulated feeds to live provider by swapping the adapter, not refactoring the app.&#x20;

---

## I. Why this is novel, and for whom

* **Coaches** get pressure-aware film replacement (Ghost Play) + chemistry-aware lineup deltas in real time.&#x20;
* **Athletes** get biomech overlays and stress-readiness cues, framed in positive, actionable feedback loops (not raw HR dumps).&#x20;
* **Front offices** get investor-grade dashboards that feel like Bloomberg—serious, fast, and exportable—while still uniquely “Texas” in polish.&#x20;

If you want, I can open a PR against `ahump20/blaze-intelligence-official` that adds:

1. `/api/*` mock endpoints,
2. the three visual modules and CSS,
3. a sample data worker for live ticks, and
4. a “swap provider” adapter to go from simulated → Sportradar/Stats Perform in minutes.


To truly elevate Blaze Intelligence into a championship‑level platform, each of the three research plans you uploaded should be fused into one cohesive architecture. Below is a concrete implementation roadmap that marries **cutting‑edge GPU‑accelerated visualization**, **pressure‑first analytics**, and an **investor‑grade design language** while remaining accessible to coaches, athletes and front‑office executives of all ages.  Key recommendations are tied to the cited research documents.

---

### 1. Adopt a GPU‑accelerated, WebGL‑centric stack

The MD brief recommends hybrid rendering—2D Canvas for small datasets and WebGL for larger ones—and highlights libraries like **Kepler.gl**, **Sigma.js** and **PixiJS**.  Implement WebGL components for heat maps, network graphs and 3D highlights, while using Canvas/D3 for real‑time line charts.  Use **DuckDB‑Wasm** on the client for 10–50× faster analytics, and build the data pipeline as Kafka → Backend → WebSockets/SSE → Frontend to keep sub‑100 ms latency.  This ensures your site remains investor‑grade on desktop and responsive on mobile.

### 2. Pressure‑centric analytics as the core narrative

Both PDFs stress that the platform’s differentiator is quantifying and visualising pressure.  The **Pressure Spectrum** defines a continuous leverage index that accounts for score, clock and context.  Build an API that streams **PressureTick** objects (timestamp, win probability, pressure, optional event) to drive a **Pressure Stream** chart.  Use D3‑Canvas to render win‑probability lines and a heat‑coded pressure band; intensity “burns” brighter when leverage peaks, making micro‑moments jump out.  This immediately answers the question “what changed the game?” for coaches and executives.

### 3. Quantified Athlete framework

Expand scouting and player development by implementing the **Trinity of Pressure Performance**—physiological resilience, psychological fortitude and tactical execution.  Integrate wearable data (HRV, VO₂, lactate threshold) to compute a **Pressure‑Readiness** score and plot it over time.  Include validated psychometric instruments (MTI, AEQ, CD‑RISC) for mental toughness and combine these with play‑by‑play efficiency metrics (EoCC) to produce a **Clutch Competency Index**.  This trifecta yields holistic dashboards for coaches (fatigue alerts), athletes (personal improvement plans) and executives (draft‑risk mitigation).

### 4. Chemistry & familiarity network

Introduce the **Familiarity Index** module from the strategy doc: track shared court time, passes and assists to quantify lineup chemistry.  Visualise interactions as a dynamic network using Sigma.js or vis.js; thicker, brighter edges indicate high‑frequency, high‑efficiency connections.  Overlay this network on a court diagram to reveal “hot zones” where certain duos excel.  Allow coaches to run “what if” substitutions and see projected impacts on chemistry and efficiency in real time.

### 5. NIL and marketability visualisation

Replace generic bar graphs with the **NIL Ribbon**: a 3D twisted ribbon where **length ∝ log(followers)**, **twist ∝ engagement rate** and **spikes ∝ awards**.  This satisfies the decision‑focused design philosophy—coaches and agents can instantly see how social reach translates into value.  Hook the ribbon to your NIL form; on submit, call `updateNILRibbon(followers, engagement/100, awards)` to morph the shape live.

### 6. Ghost Play & biomechanical overlays

For showpiece analysis and recruiting showcases, implement a **3‑D Ghost Play** reconstruction.  Render the court and players in Three.js; overlay passing lanes, Voronoi territories or defensive zones (use Delaunay triangulation for 5–10× faster Voronoi generation).  Add a **Biomech Pose Overlay**—a canvas layer that draws a smooth, glowing skeleton on live video, highlighting joints under stress.  Feed pose keypoints from MediaPipe or similar; use our provided `drawPose()` API for immediate integration.  This helps trainers spot mechanical breakdowns in real time.

### 7. Investor‑grade UX and Texas heritage

Follow the investor‑pitch aesthetic: **dark mode first**, burnt orange and cardinal blue accents, clean typography, and subtle motion that aids comprehension.  Avoid rainbow pies and gimmicks; the PDF explicitly states charts must be “immediately understandable at a glance”.  Optimise for desktop war rooms but degrade gracefully to mobile.  Build with Vite and Zustand for 30 % faster production builds and <1 KB state management; target first paint ≤ 3 s and 60 fps interactions.  Reinforce regional identity through colour and subtle motifs—Texas burnt orange stripes or playbook icons—without cluttering the UI.

### 8. Implementation roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundation** – Set up Vite build system, DuckDB‑Wasm analytics engine, Zustand, and WebSocket/SSE back‑end.  Build the Pressure Stream and KPI rings with synthetic but realistic data.
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Core Visuals** – Implement hexbin heat maps, familiarity network graphs, Sankey/flow diagrams and dynamic dashboards.  Integrate DuckDB queries for slice‑and‑dice analytics.
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Advanced Features** – Add React Suspense, service workers for offline support, a command palette, custom WebGL shaders and real‑time biometric streams.  Launch the NIL Ribbon and Clutch Competency dashboards.
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 13–16): Polish** – Optimize bundle size (<500 KB initial load), achieve consistent 60 fps, implement keyboard navigation and collaborative annotation features; add export to PDF/CSV and GIF/WEBM capture.

### 9. Compliance & data ethics

Building the Quantified Athlete means handling sensitive biometrics.  Explicit consent is mandatory and data must be anonymised, securely stored and used only for agreed‑upon purposes.  Provide athletes with clear opt‑in/out controls and audit trails to build trust.  This ensures legal compliance while enabling deep insights.

### 10. Cross‑audience accessibility

Ensure that analytics and visualisations speak to multiple audiences:

* **Coaches** see tactical recommendations (best lineup under high pressure, chemistry graphs).
* **Athletes** get personalised feedback and fatigue alerts without being overwhelmed.
* **Executives/investors** see reliability metrics (accuracy, latency) and market insights (NIL, Clutch Competency) in an investor‑grade style.

By following these implementation steps and aligning with the research‑backed strategies—pressure‑focused analytics, holistic athlete profiling, GPU‑accelerated visualisation and investor‑grade aesthetics—you can transform Blaze Intelligence into a truly novel, decision‑driving platform for teams, athletes and executives alike.
