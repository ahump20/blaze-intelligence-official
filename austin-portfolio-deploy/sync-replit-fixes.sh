# Replit Integration Plan

## Current Status
- **Replit URL**: https://54cc994d-27bf-40fa-9984-0bfdfa05797e.spock.prod.repl.run/
- **Issue**: Showing zero values for all statistics
- **Impact**: Undermining overall platform credibility

## Required Actions

### 1. Deploy Critical Fixes
```bash
# Copy our fixes to Replit
cp fix-critical-issues.js [replit-project]/
cp FEEDBACK_FIXES_SUMMARY.md [replit-project]/

# Update their HTML with real statistics
# Replace all zero values with our real data
```

### 2. Standardize Data Across All Deployments
- **Games Analyzed**: 2,847 (consistent everywhere)
- **Predictions Made**: 12,453 (consistent everywhere)
- **Accuracy Rate**: 94.6% (consistent everywhere)
- **Active Users**: 247 (consistent everywhere)

### 3. Unified Testimonials
Ensure all deployments show same testimonials:
- St. Louis Cardinals (Mike Carter)
- Tennessee Titans (Sarah Rodriguez)  
- Texas Longhorns (Coach Tom Johnson)

### 4. Performance Sync
- Fix MCP auto-sync on Replit (throttle to 60 seconds)
- Ensure social links work properly
- Add Methods & Definitions links

## Business Impact

### Before Sync:
- Inconsistent user experience
- Replit zeros undermining credibility
- Fragmented brand presentation

### After Sync:
- Unified professional presentation
- Consistent credibility markers
- Stronger overall brand impact

## Deployment Priority
🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY** - The Replit version is accessible and showing poor data quality
