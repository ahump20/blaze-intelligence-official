# Blaze Intelligence Continuous Improvement Framework

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This framework establishes systematic processes for collecting feedback, measuring success, and implementing improvements across the Blaze Intelligence platform. The goal is to create a data-driven culture of continuous enhancement that responds rapidly to user needs and market opportunities.

## ðŸ“Š Feedback Collection Systems

### 1. In-App Feedback Widget
```javascript
// Implementation for real-time user feedback
const feedbackWidget = {
  triggers: {
    passive: {
      afterFeatureUse: 30, // seconds
      onErrorEncounter: "immediate",
      exitIntent: true
    },
    active: {
      npsSchedule: "quarterly",
      featureSurvey: "after_3_uses",
      satisfactionPoll: "monthly"
    }
  },
  
  channels: {
    microSurvey: {
      maxQuestions: 2,
      completionTime: "< 30 seconds",
      format: ["rating", "single_choice"]
