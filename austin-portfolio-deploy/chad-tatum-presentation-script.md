# 🔥 BLAZE INTELLIGENCE: ORIOLES 2025-2027 DRAFT STRATEGY
## Live Demo Presentation Script for Chad Tatum

### **OPENING: THE CAMDEN YARDS OPPORTUNITY (3 minutes)**

**[Hero Section Display - Live Dashboard]**

"Chad, thank you for your time. What you're seeing is live intelligence specifically tailored to the Orioles' 2025-2027 competitive window. 

Let me start with the immediate opportunity: Camden Yards' 2025 wall changes create a **$3.2 million value arbitrage** in this draft cycle.

**[Point to Camden Impact Visualization]**

The numbers are stark:
- **29 additional home runs** projected annually
- **Park Factor increase from 93 to 108** - that's a 16% boost
- **Right-handed power premium jumps 18.5%**

Jordan Westburg alone had 6 balls that would've been home runs under the new dimensions. Ryan Mountcastle lost 11 homers over the past three seasons.

**The question isn't whether Camden creates value - it's whether you'll be the first to systematically exploit it.**

---

### **PROBLEM STATEMENT: AL EAST ARMS RACE (2 minutes)**

**[AL East Competitive Matrix Display]**

Chad, you know better than anyone - the AL East doesn't allow margin for error. Let me show you what your division rivals are doing:

**[Division Archetype Analysis Chart]**

- **Yankees**: Over-indexing on power (9/10 rating) but weak on contact (6/10)
- **Red Sox**: College polish focus but missing athletic upside
- **Rays**: Efficiency leaders but resource-constrained on premium talent
- **Blue Jays**: International heavy, domestic scouting gaps

**The inefficiency is clear**: While they chase power or polish, there's a 31% value gap in athletic defenders with emerging power - exactly what Camden Yards now rewards.

---

### **SOLUTION: BLAZE INTELLIGENCE EDGE (4 minutes)**

**[Proprietary Models Showcase]**

This is where Blaze Intelligence changes everything. We've developed six proprietary models specifically for market inefficiency exploitation:

#### **1. Camden Fit Index (CFI)**
**[Real-time CFI Calculator Display]**

Not just "can they hit home runs" - but "can they optimize Camden Yards' specific dimensions?"

Our CFI weighs:
- Wall optimization (35%)
- Pull rate advantage (25%) 
- Launch angle sweet spot (20%)
- Wind pattern benefits (15%)
- Foul territory factors (5%)

**Tyler Rodriguez** - Vanderbilt catcher - CFI of 91. His pull-heavy approach creates 15% additional value under new dimensions.

#### **2. Division Readiness Score (DRS)**
**[DRS Methodology Breakdown]**

Chad, you draft for the AL East, not Triple-A. Our DRS specifically measures:
- Performance vs. top-tier competition (30%)
- Pressure performance indicators (25%)
- 95+ mph velocity adjustment (20%)
- AL East-specific advantages (15%)

**Marcus Chen** from Stanford: DRS of 92. Why? He hit .340 against Pac-12's top arms and .385 in elimination games.

#### **3. NIL Signability Score (NSS)**
**[Signability Intelligence Dashboard]**

The game changed with NIL. We track:
- Professional vs. college earning potential (40%)
- Development pathway advantages (25%)
- Family dynamics and support systems (20%)

**Jordan Williams**, Texas high schooler: NSS of 72 seems concerning, but our deep intelligence shows family prioritizes development over short-term college income - he's signable at 110% slot.

### **PROOF POINTS: MARKET INEFFICIENCY EXPLOITATION (3 minutes)**

**[Live Market Analysis Display]**

Let me show you three specific opportunities in your draft range:

#### **Picks 32-45 Window**
**[Undervalued College Performers Visualization]**

- **15-25% value above market** available
- Focus: College performers with Camden fit
- Risk profile: Low to moderate
- Timeline: 18-24 month development

#### **Age-Based Arbitrage**
**[Age Success Rate Chart]**

The market overvalues draft age. Our data shows:
- Sub-18.3 age players: **12% higher success rate**
- Market discount: **8-15%** 
- Orioles historical advantage: You're already the leader in young player selection

#### **Positional Scarcity**
**[Position Premium Analysis]**

Premium catchers trading at 35% market premium, but our models show:
- Success rate: 67% (above market perception)
- Camden optimization potential: High
- Organizational need: Medium-High with Rutschman established

**The arbitrage is sitting right there.**
