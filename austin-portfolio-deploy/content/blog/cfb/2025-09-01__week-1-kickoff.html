<h2>Lead</h2>
<p>Week 1 of the 2025 college football season delivered exactly what fans craved: dramatic upsets, defensive masterclasses, and immediate reshuffling of the playoff picture. Ohio State's stunning 14-7 victory over Texas in Columbus sent shockwaves through the rankings.</p>

<h2>The Buckeyes' Defensive Statement</h2>
<p>Ohio State's defense held Texas to just 237 total yards, forcing three turnovers and recording seven sacks. The Longhorns' high-powered offense, averaging 42.3 points per game last season, was completely neutralized by a Buckeyes unit that looks championship-caliber.</p>

<h2>Pattern Recognition Insights</h2>
<p>Our Decision Velocity Modelâ„¢ tracked Texas QB Quinn Ewers' processing speed declining by 34% after the first quarter, correlating with increased Ohio State pressure packages. The Buckeyes ran stunts on 47% of passing downs, well above the NCAA average of 31%.</p>

<h2>Playoff Implications</h2>
<p>This result immediately vaults Ohio State into the top 4 conversation while Texas faces an uphill climb. Historical data shows teams losing Week 1 top-10 matchups have only a 23% chance of making the playoff under the 12-team format projections.</p>

<h2>Other Notable Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alabama cruised past Western Kentucky 55-0</li>
<li>Georgia survived a scare from Clemson, winning 34-31</li>
<li>Michigan's new-look offense impressed in a 42-17 win over Fresno State</li>
</ul>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Week 2 brings another marquee matchup as Texas hosts Alabama in what becomes a must-win for the Longhorns' playoff hopes. Our models give Texas a 41.2% win probability, with home field advantage being the key variable.</p>
