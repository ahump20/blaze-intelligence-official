<h2>Lead</h2>
<p>College football's 2025 season opened with seismic shocks that immediately reshaped the playoff landscape. Ohio State's dominant defensive performance toppled #1 Texas 14-7, while Florida State announced their return with a stunning 31-17 victory over Alabama.</p>

<h2>The Biggest Upset: FSU Shocks Alabama</h2>
<p>Florida State's 31-17 victory over Alabama wasn't just an upset—it was a statement. The Seminoles' offensive line, completely rebuilt from last year's disaster, held Alabama to just one sack while paving the way for 187 rushing yards.</p>

<h2>Texas Falls in Columbus</h2>
<p>The Arch Manning era at Texas began with frustration as Ohio State's defense suffocated the Longhorns' high-powered offense. Manning completed just 18 of 34 passes for 156 yards, with two interceptions that sealed Texas's fate.</p>
