<h3>Derrick Henry Workload Management</h3>
<p>At age 31, Henry's usage will be critical. Our models suggest optimal usage:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Target Carries:</strong> 18-22 (not the 30+ of previous years)</li>
    <li><strong>Red Zone Touches:</strong> 65% of team attempts inside 20</li>
    <li><strong>Third Down Usage:</strong> Limited to 3rd-and-short (â‰¤3 yards)</li>
    <li><strong>Projected Stats:</strong> 21 carries, 87 yards, 1.2 TDs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Defensive X-Factors</h3>
<div class="defensive-preview">
    <h4>Jeffrey Simmons Impact</h4>
    <p>Simmons generated pressure on 13.2% of pass rushes last season (4th among DTs). Against Chicago's interior line ranking 24th in pass block win rate, expect 5+ pressures.</p>
    
    <h4>Secondary Matchups</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Kristian Fulton on DJ Moore: 48.2% completion rate allowed in shadow coverage</li>
        <li>Safety rotation: Amani Hooker playing deep, Kevin Byard in the box</li>
        <li>Nickel package usage: Projected 67% of defensive snaps</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Win Probability Factors</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Turnover Battle:</strong> Teams winning TO margin in Week 1 are 31-9 since 2020 (77.5%)</li>
    <li><strong>Third Down Defense:</strong> Hold Chicago under 35% conversion rate</li>
    <li><strong>Time of Possession:</strong> Target 32+ minutes with Henry/Pollard rotation</li>
    <li><strong>Special Teams:</strong> Randy Bullock must hit FGs; field position battle critical</li>
</ol>

<h3>Final Score Prediction</h3>
<p class="prediction-box">
    <strong>Titans 24, Bears 20</strong><br>
    Confidence: 58.3%<br>
    Key Stat: Titans cover -3 spread in 61% of simulations
