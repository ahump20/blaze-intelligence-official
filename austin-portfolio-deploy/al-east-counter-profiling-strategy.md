# üéØ AL EAST COUNTER-PROFILING STRATEGY
## Blaze Intelligence: Systematic Division Advantage Creation

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The AL East represents baseball's most competitive division, with five organizations consistently competing for limited playoff spots. Traditional scouting approaches focus on absolute talent acquisition, but championship-level organizations exploit systematic inefficiencies in their rivals' evaluation models.

**Blaze Intelligence has identified a 31% value gap in athletic defenders with emerging power** - precisely the archetype Camden Yards' 2025 changes now reward, and exactly what division rivals are systematically undervaluing.
