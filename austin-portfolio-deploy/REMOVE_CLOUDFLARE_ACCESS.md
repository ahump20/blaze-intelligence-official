# üö® REMOVE CLOUDFLARE ACCESS - URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

**Current Status:** All Blaze Intelligence pages are protected by Cloudflare Access, preventing public access to demos, calculators, and marketing content.

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE STEPS TO REMOVE ACCESS PROTECTION**

### **1. Access Cloudflare Dashboard**
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Log in with your Cloudflare account
3. Select your account/team: `ahump20`

### **2. Navigate to Cloudflare Access**
1. In the left sidebar, click **"Zero Trust"**
2. Click **"Access"** 
3. Click **"Applications"**

### **3. Find Blaze Intelligence Applications**
Look for applications protecting these domains:
- `*.blaze-intelligence.com`
- `d375794b.blaze-intelligence.com`
- Any other Blaze Intelligence subdomains

### **4. Remove or Disable Access Applications**
For each Blaze Intelligence application:

**Option A - Delete Application (Recommended):**
1. Click the **three dots (‚ãØ)** next to the application
2. Select **"Delete"**
3. Confirm deletion

**Option B - Disable Application:**
1. Click on the application name
2. Toggle **"Enable application"** to OFF
3. Save changes

### **5. Alternative: Modify Application Policy**
If you want to keep the application but make it public:
1. Click on the application name
2. Go to **"Policies"** tab
3. Edit the existing policy
4. Change action from **"Allow"** to **"Bypass"**
5. Or change rules to allow **"Everyone"** or **"Any Access application"**

## üîç **VERIFICATION STEPS**

After removing Access protection, test these URLs:

```bash
# Main site
curl -I https://d375794b.blaze-intelligence.com/

# Performance demo  
curl -I https://d375794b.blaze-intelligence.com/performance-demo.html

# Cost calculator
curl -I https://d375794b.blaze-intelligence.com/savings-calculator.html

# MLB showcase
curl -I https://d375794b.blaze-intelligence.com/mlb-intelligence-showcase.html

# Sources & methods
curl -I https://d375794b.blaze-intelligence.com/sources-methods.html
```

**Expected Result:** HTTP 200 responses instead of HTTP 302 redirects

## üìã **CURRENT ACCESS CONFIGURATION DETECTED**

Based on the redirect response, your Access application is configured with:
- **Host:** `ahump20.cloudflareaccess.com`  
- **Protected Domain:** `d375794b.blaze-intelligence.com`
- **Authentication:** Required for all paths (`/`)

## ‚ö° **WHY THIS IS CRITICAL**

**Business Impact:**
- ‚ùå Prospects cannot view performance demos
- ‚ùå Cost calculator is inaccessible  
- ‚ùå Research citations are blocked
- ‚ùå Technical showcases require authentication
- ‚ùå All marketing content is behind login wall

**Immediate Actions After Removal:**
1. ‚úÖ All demos become publicly accessible
2. ‚úÖ Prospects can test performance comparisons
3. ‚úÖ Cost calculators work for lead generation
4. ‚úÖ Research backing builds credibility
5. ‚úÖ Technical superiority is demonstrable

## üö® **URGENT PRIORITY**

This is blocking all prospect access to your championship-level technical demonstrations. Remove Access protection immediately to enable:
- Performance demo showing 2ms response times
- Cost calculator proving 25-50% savings
- MLB intelligence showcase with live data
- Research-backed credibility through sources page

**Every minute with Access enabled = lost prospects who can't see your technical dominance.**
